## ✅ Automatic Testing with Google Test (Gtest)
We implemented over 26 comprehensive unit and integration tests using Google Test:
How to Run:
```bash
cd build
cmake ..
make
ctest

🕹️ Visual Simualation 🎨:
Written in C++ with ncurses libary, it offers unique diffrent 🎨colors for up to 9 diffrent player Tanks, along with all the directions
allowing running back and forward in the Simualation with the arrows keys.

▶️ To Run with Visualization, add the --visual flag. For example:
cd build
cmake ..
make
./tanks_game ../files/tests/maps/test_map_1.txt --visual

📝 Logging Bonus:
A logging system was implemented that writes to a log.txt file in the build directory.
For each tank, the log records every action taken in each round, including the round number, step count, player ID, tank ID, AI algorithm name, action name, remaining ammunition, and cooldown status.
This feature is especially useful for debugging and provides a clear, detailed view of the game's flow and the decision-making process of each tank.

👥 Support for Up to 9 Players:
The game engine supports battles with up to 9 players. A fourth input file demonstrating this feature is included:
