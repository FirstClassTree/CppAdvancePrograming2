Visual Simualation:
Written in C++ with ncurses libary, it offers unique diffrent colors for up to 9 diffrent player Tanks, along with all the directions
allowing running back and forward in the Simualation with the arrows keys.

To Run with visualizaion add --visual, e.g.:
cd build
cmake ..
make 
./tanks_game ../files/tests/maps/test_map_1.txt --visual 


Logging Bonus
Implement a logging system that writes to a log.txt file in the build directiory. 
For each tank, log every action it takes in each round, including the round number, step count, player ID, tank ID, AI algorithm name, action name, remaining ammo, and cooldown. 
This feature is valuable for debugging and provides a precise understanding of the game's flow and decision-making process.
